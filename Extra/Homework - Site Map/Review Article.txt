I fully agree with the article on UX. It is extremely easy to start with a solution and ignore a problem. The articles digs into where problems lie, and how to flesh them out first in order to solve them. I agree with the section on collaboration and communication early on with designers, developers etc. When making a new product, there are several different opinions, and roadblocks that need to be accessed with different eyes. I also think that sketching out a problem and interface is very helpful. In another class, we were given a task and then needed to sketch out the problem and solution on the board. After seeing the sketch, we noticed a lot of problems with the design that we didn’t think about when we were simply discussing the idea. Finally, I agree that presenting the problem to the right audience is important. Simple vs detailed wireframes will depend on who is viewing it, what their objective, is and what information is crucial to their job.
